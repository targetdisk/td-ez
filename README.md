# Targetdisk Cable Firmware
### for Cypress EZ-USB FX2

This firmware is for the Cypress CY7C68013 EZ-USB FX2 chip.

## Flashing
Note that I have only successfully loaded firmware with the Python `fx2tool`.

> I have included the GPL-licensed `fxload` as a submodule with this repository
> (for now), but I am currently not supporting as the preferred method of uploading
> firmware to my FX2 hardware.
